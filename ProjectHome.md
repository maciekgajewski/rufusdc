# Summary #
DC++ client for KDE 4. Uses DC++ core, as for now - version  0.75

I tried to implement DC++ client from scratch, and succeeded partially. But since guys from [LinuxDC++](https://launchpad.net/linuxdcpp) did all the hard work making [DC++](http://dcplusplus.sourceforge.net/) core running on Linux, I decided to switch.

Kudos to [DC++](http://dcplusplus.sourceforge.net/) and [LinuxDC++](https://launchpad.net/linuxdcpp). The code is clear, well-designed, easy to read and to integrate.

# Status #
2009-07-05
Switched to DC++ core, development going fast. Not usable now, but since it shares config with linuxdcpp, you can use RufusDC to see how downloads/uploads are progressing, and to chat with hub users.

# Background story #
My friend, Rufus, says that lack of good DC++ client is one of the biggest obstacles for him to switch to Linux. His favourite DC++ client is [StrongDC](http://strongdc.sourceforge.net/). It does run under WINE, but is not as useful as in native environment. At the other hand, Linux DC clients, like [LinuxDC++](http://linuxdcpp.berlios.de) or [Valknut](http://wxdcgui.sourceforge.net/), lacks multi-download features.



# Old Summary (valid to January 2009) #
A (yet another) Linux DC++ client. Uses KDE4 and boost libraries.

# Goals #

  * Provide folks like Rufus with good, usable DC++ client.
  * Learn KDE4 and boost libraries.
  * Learn CMake

Current TODO list:
  * Add more recent screenshot to the page
  * Go on with development!
  * Release 0.1 soon
  * Apply for inclusion into [KDE Extragear](http://extragear.kde.org/).
